          Giro was the final project of a 4-weeks course I took with <a href="https://trydesignlab.com/">DesignLab</a>. The course covered the entire design process from concept, creation, iteration into a finished product. The challenge was to create a concept for a product which would promote a city of my choice, targeted to a specific niche. The final deliverable was a high-fidelity landing page, along with the worked-out product concept and branding.

        <h3>My role & tasks</h3>
        <ul class="my-role">
          <li><h4>Wireframing</h4></li>
          <li><h4>UX & UI design</h4></li>
          <li><h4>Branding concept</h4></li>

      <!--User research-->
        <h3>Discovery & ideation</h3>
          <p>
            I had followed IDEO's design thinking methodology during the ideation phase of the project.
            The city I chose to focus on for the project was Milan, Italy. In order to find a specific angle for an interesting promotional product, I had interviewed various people about their perceptions of Milan, Italians and foreigners alike.  A common pattern I had identified during these interviews is, Milan is often seen as a city for work, with good job opportunities, but not much charm. As my subjects had explained, Milan is known primarily as a hub for commerce, banking and fashion. Its cultural sights are lesser known, especially in comparison with other Italian cities like Rome, Venice or Florence, which have a world-famous cultural heritage. This core finding has led to the formulation of my primary design problem: "How might we promote a side of Milan that is not only about fashion and business?"
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to answer this question while keeping user interests in mind, I had created two personas, Kate and Angelo:
          </p>
          <div class="giro-personas ia-img-div">
            <div>
              <img class="giro-image" src="images/giro-kate.png" / >
              <p>
                <em>Persona #1: Kate</em>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img class="giro-image" src="images/giro-angelo.png" / >
              <p>
                <em>Persona #1: Angelo</em>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            What solutions might address these user problems? How could the solution be delivered to them in a hassle-free way, as something they could do in their own time? As a result of various design thinking brainstorming exercises (mind map, top five etc.), I had developed the idea of self-guided city walks in Milan, organized around various topics of interest (such as food, history, music and others).
          </p>

        <h3>Design & Branding</h3>
          <h2>Landing page wireframing</h2>
          <p>
            Following the guidelines of rapid prototyping, I had created various visual and communication concepts for the product's landing page. The final design was then iteratively created as a combined and refined version of these first sketches, based on feedback from my mentor during feedback sessions.
          </p>
          <img class="giro-image" src="images/giro-sketches.png" / >

          <h2 class="giro-logo-h2">Logo Design</h2>
          <p>
            The next steps were creating the visuals and branding for the product: choosing a suitable typeface, color palette, imagery and designing a logo. The logo design process in particular was an excellent learning opportunity for me, and one which I had greatly enjoyed.
          </p>

          <div class="ia-img-div">
            <img class="giro-logo-sketch" src="images/giro-logo-sketch.png" / >
            <p>
              <em>Hand-drawn and digital logo design sketches</em>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class>High-fidelity mockups</h2>

          <div class="giro-personas">
            <img class="giro-image" src="images/giro-ipad1.png" / >
            <img class="giro-image end-space" src="images/giro-ipad2.png" / >
          </div>

      <h3>Conclusion & Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        What I've learned from this project:
        <ul>
          <li>
            IDEO's design thinking practices for ideation come in handy no matter the size of the project! At first I was unsure whether it made sense to apply them to a small-scale practice project, but I was amazed with how much it helped me get done.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've learned a lot about logo design, and had a lot of fun messing around with different concepts!
          </li>
        </ul>
